# Introduction

ExpandableTabBar is an iOS custom tab bar control. Its behavior emulates
the system tab bar with the addition of supporting multiple rows.

## Usage

copy the files to your own project.

## Current State

Some animation features are unsupported and rotational animation could
be improved.
